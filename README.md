- This project is a job finding site. There are several types of jobs of different companies are given here, from there you can apply for specific jobs.

* This site has 4 Menu on Navbar which is: Home, Statistics, Applied Jobs and Blog

* In landing/home pages I have created a Banner where I some texts and button on the left and a image on the right side.

* Below the banner page set some job category list, getting data from json file.

* And next show 4 different types of jobs in FeaturedJobs component

* Finally in end of the landing page I set a button named(show more). When click there, show all the featured jobs from json data.

* Now let's come to the main point, inside every featured jobs card set a button "View Details".

* When click there, it will take us to the job details component.

* Inside job details component I gave so many job related information. And at the side of this component have a Apply Job Button, where we can apply a specific job.

* Applied jobs will be stored in local storage of your browser. For that, you can your check previous apply job, despite close the website or close the browser.

* All applied job stores in AppliedJobs page. There I gave two button for the filtering of job types. I mean, whether is remote or onsite... When we click the remote button, that will show us all the "remote jobs". And when we click the onsite button that will show us all the "onsite jobs"

* And finally I added a another page call blog. Where I gave 4 answer of React related question.
